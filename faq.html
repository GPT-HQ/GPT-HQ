    </details>

    <details class="guide-block">
        <summary>What are offerwalls?</summary>
        <p>Offerwalls are third‑party providers that supply tasks such as apps, games, surveys, and sign‑ups. Each offerwall has its own tracking and payout system.</p>
    </details>

    <!-- SAFETY -->
    <details class="guide-block">
        <summary>Can I use a VPN on GPT sites?</summary>
        <p>No. Using a VPN is against the rules on most platforms and can lead to bans or reversed earnings.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="guide-block">
        <summary>Why was my account flagged or banned?</summary>
        <p>Accounts are usually flagged for VPN usage, multiple accounts, inconsistent survey answers, or suspicious activity. Contact support if you believe it was a mistake.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="guide-block">
        <summary>Are GPT sites safe to use?</summary>
        <p>Reputable GPT platforms are safe, but you should never share sensitive personal information. Stick to trusted sites listed on GPT‑HQ.</p>
    </details>

    <!-- EARNING -->
    <details class="guide-block">
        <summary>How much can I realistically earn?</summary>
        <p>Earnings vary by country and time spent. Some users earn a few dollars per day, while others earn more by completing high‑value offers and surveys.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="guide-block">
        <summary>Why do earnings differ between countries?</summary>
        <p>Advertisers pay different rates depending on region. Countries with higher ad budgets typically offer higher payouts.</p>
    </details>

    <details class="guide-block">
        <summary>How do I increase my earnings?</summary>
        <p>Focus on high‑value offers, keep your survey profiles updated, avoid VPNs, and check multiple offerwalls for the best rates.</p>

    <!-- SURVEYS -->
    <details class="guide-block">
        <summary>Why do surveys disqualify me?</summary>

    </details>

    <!-- TECHNICAL -->
    <details class="guide-block">
        <summary>Why do some offers not track?</summary>
        <p>Tracking issues usually happen when cookies are blocked, VPN is used, or the offer was started before clicking through the GPT site. Always follow instructions exactly.</p>
    </details>

        <summary>How fast can I withdraw?</summary>
